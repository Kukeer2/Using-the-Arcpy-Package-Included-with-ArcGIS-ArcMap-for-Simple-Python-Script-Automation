# Using-the-Arcpy-Package-Included-with-ArcGIS-ArcMap-for-Simple-Python-Script-Automation
This project aims to utilize the Arcpy package in ArcGIS (ArcMap) to automate the calculation and analysis of environmental parameters such as temperature, precipitation, and NPP (Net Primary Productivity) for five types of terrain in Wuhan. The main steps of the project include extracting and calculating the area, meteorological data, and carbon sink from Wuhan's Shapefile and corresponding PNG images, and finally outputting the results to an Excel file. By using automated Python scripts, the project significantly enhances the efficiency of data processing and reduces the complexity of manual operations. The entire workflow demonstrates how to combine Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with programming techniques to achieve precise spatial data analysis and environmental monitoring.
